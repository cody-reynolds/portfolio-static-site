# portfolio-static-site
 Web development portfolio site using node.js and express

This project uses node.js, express, and pug to create a portfolio website of web development projects I've completed so far, with an "about me" page and pages for each individual project. 

The app uses express to modularize the code into public (static assets), routes (request and response routing), and views (HTML templates) sections. I used Pug to create templates that expand the content in a layout file, which is compiled to HTML.

Background Color:
Changed background color on sidebar to #020d22

Reduced letter-spacing on link text to 1px.

Color:

Changed sidebar link text to off-white (#e3ded9)
