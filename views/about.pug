            | Hi, I'm Cody, a web developer based in Atlanta, GA.
            | Before learning to code, I was a procurement consultant in the supply chain management industry.
            | While on the job, I often noticed that my clients were looking for great new vendors to work with, but had difficulty finding them because they had little or no online presence.
          p  
            | I left my job in early 2021 so that I could solve this problem by building applications that help small businesses get discovered and thrive on the Internet.
